        <p>
            I've been developing software professionally for 7 years now. For the last 3 years I've been working as a
            web developer, and I'm working to improve and expand my skill-set. I graduated with a degree in game
            development, and I have a mobile game in the works.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think of myself as a game developer first, and a web developer second. That being said, I've learned a lot
            of new strategies for solving problems, testing, and structuring code to work in the web. In this course,
            I'd like to continue growing as a developer, and address the areas where my skills are weakest.
